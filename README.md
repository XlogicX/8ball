If my hivsneeze script were an overimplimentation of EICAR for AV, than this script is intented to be the same type of overimplementation of testmyids.com for open source Intrusion Detection systems.

Snot and Stick served some inspiration, this script is similar, but adds the ability to be 'stateful' and has a decent pcre generation engine (gets about 90%+ of them right). Or, with the speedball (-l) option, it will get them all wrong, but as slowly as possible (becuase RE:DoS).
